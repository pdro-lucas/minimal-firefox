# ðŸ¦Š My Firefox Customization

This keyboard-focused theme is designed for a minimalist interface, with some buttons removed to streamline navigation. It is based on the [Cascade](https://github.com/andreasgrafen/cascade) theme, featuring only a few modifications.

This theme also repositions the tab bar horizontally, which is made possible thanks to the [Tab Center Reborn extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/tabcenter-reborn/). Please download and install the extension to enjoy this feature.
